This suggests that the time commitment required by the program might be challenging for some participants


                **Dissatisfaction with Teaching Styles:** A few students have expressed dissatisfaction with the teaching styles of specific mentors, mentioning issues such as pace and detail. This indicates that there may be differences in how well mentors are delivering the curriculum, which could affect student engagement and satisfaction.


                **Class Duration:** Students have mentioned concerns about class durations, suggesting that classes sometimes exceed the expected time frame. This can impact students' ability to absorb information effectively and could be related to the curriculum structure and mentorship.
